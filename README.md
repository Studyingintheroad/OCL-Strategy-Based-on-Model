# OCL-Strategy-Based-on-Model
Our research demonstrates that the Online Co-Learning (OCL) strategy enhances the model's performance in ECG classification. We aim to contribute to the field of 12-lead ECG classification through this work. As our new project is closely related to OCL strategy research, we plan to organize and publicly release the key code that embodies the core principles of the OCL strategy once we complete the application of this strategy to wearable devices. This will be made available for reference and use by other researchers in the field.
