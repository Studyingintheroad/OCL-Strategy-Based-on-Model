# OCL-Strategy-Based-on-Model
Our research demonstrates that the OCL strategy enhances the model's performance in 12-lead ECG classification. We aim to contribute to the field of 12-lead ECG classification through this work. Currently, we are organizing and refining the code to ensure it is user-friendly, and we plan to publicly release the key code reflecting the core principles of the OCL strategy after the article is officially published, making it available for reference and use by other researchers in the field.
